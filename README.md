# QR Code Challenge - Frontend Mentor
This repository contains my solution for the QR Code Challenge from Frontend Mentor. The project is built entirely with HTML and CSS and focuses on delivering a clean, responsive design that meets the challenge specifications. Key aspects include:

Responsive Layout: Ensures the design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
Minimalist Design: Emphasizes simplicity and visual clarity.
Clean Code: Organized and maintainable code structure following best practices.
Feel free to explore the code and share your feedback!
