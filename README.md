# QR Code Challenge - Frontend Mentor
This repository contains my solution for the QR Code Challenge from Frontend Mentor. The project is built entirely with HTML and CSS and focuses on delivering a clean, responsive design that meets the challenge specifications. Key aspects include: <br><br>

Responsive Layout: Ensures the design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes. <br><br>
Minimalist Design: Emphasizes simplicity and visual clarity. <br><br>
Clean Code: Organized and maintainable code structure following best practices. <br><br>
Feel free to explore the code and share your feedback! <br><br>
